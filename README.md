# Silence Phobia's stage lighting control system
![SP](https://i.ibb.co/j3DcvMV/silence-mini.png)

This code is a simple Arduino sketch to control a 5-relay output module to perform 6 "modes" (actually speed variations) of stage lighting sequence animation.

Unfortunately, there's no schematics nor any sort of decent documentation.
If you read this code and find anything useful in it (software debounce for example), please feel free to copy and use it any way you want it.

In fact, it's just a personal project for the band I'm in, which I'm the lead singer and it's called **SILENCE PHOBIA**.
